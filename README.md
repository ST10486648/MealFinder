The MealFinder app is a simple Android application designed to help users choose a meal based on the time of day. It suggests a random meal from a predefined list and displays an image along with the name of the meal. The purpose of the app is to make it easier for users to decide what to eat, whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack.

From a design perspective, the app features a user-friendly interface with a dark background and light-colored text for readability. It uses a ScrollView containing a vertical LinearLayout to ensure it works well on different screen sizes. The input is collected using an EditText field, and two buttons are providedâ€”one to suggest a meal and another to clear the content. Suggestions are displayed in a TextView, and an image is shown in an ImageView.

The app also includes a section listing acceptable time inputs to guide the user and reduce errors. If an invalid input is entered, a helpful message appears to inform the user. Overall, the app is designed to be simple, efficient, and easy to use.
